    "## Datalab\n",
    "\n",
    "#### what is it?\n",
    "Jupyter notebook hosted on GCP (for free!)    \n",
    "More technical: it's a docker image of jupyter and some other python stuff running on a GCP compute engine that Google spins up for you (https://github.com/googledatalab/datalab/tree/master/containers/datalab)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How to use it? \n",
    "from the glcoud shell, create a datalab instance:\n",
    "`datalab create gcp-example --project ian-sandbox-221014 --zone us-east1-b`\n",

    "##### How to manage it?\n",
    "`datalab list`   \n",
    "`datalab stop gcp-example`    \n",

    "`datalab delete gcp-example`    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why use datalab? \n",
    "1. Free/easy development environment management \n",
    "2. If using BigQuery, BigTable, etc, Datalab can easily connect\n",
    "3. Integrated with ML-Engine for easy scaling and access to Tensorflow hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why not use datalab?\n",
    "1. Kind of annoying to spin up/spin down\n",
    "2. Less flexible than maintaining your own development environment (e.g., harder to use typical developer tools like `git`)\n",
    "3. No obvious way to use `R`\n"

    "1. Auto-scaling model training engine\n",
    "2. Model deployment, management, and verison control framework\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to use it?\n",
    "Use the GCP console to look at ML jobs and managed models\n",

    "2. Is it possible to train/deploy on Cloud ML using anything besides Tensorflow?     \n",
    "    2a. Yes, later versions (Version > 1.0) of the cloud ML runtime support Tensorflow, Sk-learn, and XGBoost (https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/scikit/quickstart)    \n",
    "3. Basic steps for deploying a model    \n",
    "    3a. Train a model somewhere and do all that magic stuff to make it good    \n",
    "    3b. Save model to a file (file type depends on framework used)    \n",
    "    3c. Use `gcloud` command line tool to deploy model from file and version it    \n",
    "4. How does scoring a model work if input data needs cleaning??    \n",
    "    4a. Just clean the data before it's scored, bro    \n",
    "    4b. If the model is deployed using Tensorflow, a `serving_input_fn` can be added to the model object to handle some maniulation of scoring inputs (https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst/blob/master/courses/machine_learning/cloudmle/taxifare/trainer/model.py#L92)"
